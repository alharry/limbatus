  abstract = {We examined life history traits (e.g., mean length-at-age, growth rate, age-at-maturity) for blacktip sharks collected from two separate geographical areas (eastern Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Bight) to address the potential for separate stocks in southeastern US waters. Samples were obtained from fishery-dependent and independent sources. Growth and logistic models were fitted to observed length-at-age and reproductive data, respectively. von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived for blacktip shark from the Gulf of Mexico show that they attain a statistically smaller theoretical maximum length (L-infinity = 141.6 cm vs. L-infinity = 158.5 cm for female and L-infinity = 126.0 cm FL and L-infinity = 147.4 cm FL for male) and have a faster growth rate (k = 0.24 yr(-1) vs. k = 0.16 yr(-1)s for female and k = 0.27 yr(-1) vs. k = 0.21 yr(-1) for male) than conspecifics in the South Atlantic Bight. Median length- and age-at-maturity were significantly different between sex and area. Length at which 50\% of the population is mature was 117.3 cm FL for females and 103.4 cm FL for males in the Gulf of Mexico and 126.6 cm FL for females and 116.7 cm FL for males in the South Atlantic Bight. Median age-at-maturity was 5.7 yrs and 4.5 yrs for females and males in the Gulf of Mexico, respectively, while age-at-maturity was 6.7 yrs for females and 5.0 yrs for males for sharks from the South Atlantic Bight. Due to varying statistical results, temporal problems of sampling, and potential for gear bias, we could not definitively conclude that differences in life history characteristics exist.},

  issn = {1175-5326},
  abstract = {The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted, with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Having previously been considered a monotypic genus with a single recognized species, Manta birostris (Walbaum 1792), new evidence, in the form of morphological and meristic data, confirm that two visually distinct species occur, both with wide ranging distributions through many of the world's oceans. Manta birostris stands as the most widely distributed member of the genus, while Manta alfredi (Krefft 1868), resurrected herein, represents a smaller, more tropical species. Separation of the two species is based on morphometric measurements and external characters including colouration, dentition, denticle and spine morphology, as well as size at maturity and maximum disc width. The two species of Manta are sympatric in some locations and allopatric in other regions. A visual key was constructed which highlights the conspicuous, diagnostic features of the two species using data collected throughout their respective geographical ranges. A third, putative species, referred to here as Manta sp. cf. birostris, in the Atlantic may be distinct from M. birostris, but further examination of specimens is necessary to clarify the taxonomic status of this variant manta ray. The results of this study will aid in the differentiation of members of this genus both in the field and in preserved specimens. The splitting of this long-standing monospecific genus will help to highlight the specific threats facing the different species of Manta (e. g. targeted fishing, bycatch fisheries, boat strikes and habitat degradation) and will ultimately assist in the correct assessment of their respective worldwide conservation status.},

  abstract = {This study reports on evidence for reproductive isolation among Orectolobus ornatus and Orectolobus halei, two previously cryptic and recently redescribed species of wobbegong shark (Orectolobiformes: Orectolobidae) from the east coast of Australia. The evidence is based on disparity in size at sexual maturity, diagnostic nuclear and mitochondrial DNA variants, and marked phylogenetic divergence. Plots of total length (L(T)) and maturity for the two species were non-overlapping and illustrative of statistically significant size dimorphism. Genetic analyses and phylogenetic reconstruction did not provide indication of hybridization between O. ornatus and O. halei. In fact, sequence divergence between them was higher than in comparisons with another congeneric and largely co-distributed wobbegong species (Orectolobus maculatus). The assumption of a molecular clock revealed that the two species have evolved in isolation for c. 3.9 million years. These results challenge a paradigm often mentioned in the biodiversity literature that most cryptic species are the product of recent speciation events and will contribute to the development of effective management strategies for wobbegong sharks.},

  volume = {59},
  issn = {0706-652X},
  abstract = {A population of young blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) was monitored over three years to determine their mortality rates using a series of acoustic listening stations. Based on these data it was possible to use several mortality estimators, including indirect life history based methods and direct methods such as the Kaplan-Meier and SURVIV methods, to estimate natural, fishing, and total mortality. Kaplan-Meier (61-91\%) and SURVIV (62-92\%) methods provided nearly identical total mortality rates during the first six months of life. This agreement suggests that these estimates are accurate for this population. All natural and fishing mortality occurred within the first 15 weeks of the study. This suggests that young sharks are most vulnerable to all types of mortality during this period. Sharks that survived beyond the first 15 weeks successfully left the nursery and were presumed to have migrated southward during fall months. These results provide critical information concerning the early life history of sharks and the importance of nursery areas to the survival of young animals.},

  abstract = {McAuley, R. B., Simpfendorfer, C. A., and Hall, N. G. 2007. A method for evaluating the impacts of fishing mortality and stochastic influences on the demography of two long-lived shark stocks. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64. Stochastic demographic models were developed for Carcharhinus obscurus and C. plumbeus populations off the west coast of Australia by resampling the input parameters for life tables from empirical biological data collected from commercial target fisheries and fishery-independent surveys. The models were used to examine the effects of multiple scenarios of age-specific survival, derived from the fishing mortality rates estimated from a tagging study on sharks and indirect estimates of natural mortality. In the absence of fishing, median estimates of the rates of intrinsic population increase (r) were 0.025 for both species. Inclusion of the age-specific fishing mortality rates estimated for C. obscurus recruits born in 1994 and 1995 resulted in the median estimates of r declining to 0.007 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that recent harvest levels of mainly neonates by the target fishery were probably sustainable. However, the model also suggested that the population was more susceptible to exploitation of older sharks than was previously believed. The C. plumbeus model indicated that fishing mortality between 2001 and 2004 was probably unsustainable. The increasingly negative trend in median r estimates (from 0.032 to 0.049), and the population's apparently limited capacity for density-dependent compensation through changes in fecundity, somatic growth and longevity, suggests that management intervention is necessary to prevent continued stock depletion.},

  volume = {37},
  doi = {10.1071/MF9860671},
  abstract = {Sharks represent 78\% of the total catch by weight of a Taiwanese surface gill-net fishery off northern Australia. Two carcharhinids, \emph{Carcharhrnus tilstoni} (previously described as \emph{C. limbatus}) and \emph{C. sorrah}, together comprise 83\% of this shark catch by number. \emph{C. tilstoni} is distinguished from \emph{C. limbatus} by differences in enzyme systems, vertebral counts, size data and pelvic fin coloration. Of the specimens of \emph{C. tilstoni} and \emph{C. sorrah} caught in the Arafura and Timor Seas from 1981 to 1983, 43\% and 47\%, respectively, were female; at birth these proportions were 46\% and 50\%, respectively. In both species, females tended to be relatively more abundant in catches of mature fish, except around March, when males predominated. In northern Australia, the usual size at maturity for \emph{C. tilstoni} is 110 cm for males and 115 cm for females; for \emph{C. sorrah}, it is 90 cm and 95 cm, respectively. Both species exhibit placental viviparity and have almost identical restricted reproductive cycles. Mating occurs in February-March, ovulation in March-April and the main parturition period is in January. The gestation period is 10 months and individual fish breed each year. The average litter size for both species is three. The size at birth is about 60 cm for \emph{C. tilstoni} and 50 cm for \emph{C. sorrah}. Stomach contents indicate that teleost fish are an important component of the diet of both species and there is some indication of a change in feeding depth with shark size.},

  issn = {0399-0974},
  abstract = {The blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, is commonly captured along the west coast of Africa and rarely in the Mediterranean, where it was recorded in the Gulf of Gabs (southern Tunisia). Following competition pressure from its sympatric species, the sandbar shark, C. plumbeus and the spinner shark, C. brevipinna, it migrated northward into the Gulf of Tunis and off the Algerian coast. Adult males and females reached over 167 cm and 178 cm total length (TL), respectively. The largest male and the largest female were 216 cm and 245 cm TL, respectively. They were no significant differences of relationship of mass versus TL between males and females. C. limbatus is a placental viviparous elasmo-branch. Adult females had a single ovary and two functional uteri, in which encapsulated eggs and embryos were not equally distributed. Mating occurred in Spring or in early Summer, with parturition in July. Gestation lasted approximately one year. There is perhaps a biannual reproductive cycle. In some specimens, vitellogenesis proceeded in parallel with gestation. Diameter of the largest yellow yolked oocytes ranged from 23 to 25 mm (mean: 23.95 +/- 0.80) and their mass from 5.9 to 8.4 g (mean: 7.48 +/- 0.92). Both uteri were compartmentalised into chambers and a single embryo developed in each chamber. Size and mass at birth, based on fully developed embryos, and the smallest free-swimming specimens (neonates) were between 61-65 cm TL and 0.935-1.375 kg respectively. A chemical balance of development based on mean dry masses of the largest yellow yolked oocytes and the fully developed embryos was \# 69. It was the highest value ever computed in a viviparous elasmobranch, and confirmed that C. limbatus is a matrotrophic species. Ovarian fecundity was slightly higher than uterine fecundity. There was a slight relationship between the two categories of fecundity and the females TL. Litter sizes ranged from 6 to 8. Among the embryos and the free-swimming specimens the females outnumbered the males ones. This was not the case for the adults.},

  abstract = {"Ecological" speciation occurs when reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent selection between populations exploiting different resources or environments. We tested this hypothesis of speciation in a young stickleback species pair by measuring the direct contribution of ecological selection pressures to hybrid fitness. The two species (Limnetic and benthic) are strongly differentiated morphologically and ecologically, whereas hybrids are intermediate. Fitness of hybrids is high in the laboratory, especially Fl and Fz hybrids(backcrosses may show some breakdown). We transplanted FI hybrids to enclosures in the two main habitats in the wild to test whether the distribution of resources available in the environment generates a hybrid disadvantage not detectable in the laboratory. Hybrids grew more slowly than limnetics in the open water habitat and more slowly than benthics in the littoral zone. Growth of Fl hybrids was inferior to the average of the parent species across both habitats, albeit not significantly. The contrast between laboratory and field results supports the hypothesis that mechanisms of Fl hybrid fitness in the wild are primarily ecological and do not result from intrinsic genetic incompatibilities. Direct selection on hybrids contributes to the maintenance of sympatric stickleback species and may have played an important role in their origin.},

  volume = {66},
  abstract = {The confounded effects of changes in climate and density on a population\&rsquo;s demography are hard to separate for long-lived species because demographic traits are usually the aggregated result of conditions faced over years. Demographic parameters are compared for spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) in the Northeast Pacific, the longest lived and latest maturing of all sharks, using samples from the 1940s and 2000s. This 60-year interval has seen ocean temperatures rise by almost 1\^A~\^A$^\circ$C and dogfish harvests peak above 50\^A~000 tonnes (t)\^A$\cdot$annum\&ndash;1 and then drop below 50 t\^A$\cdot$annum\&ndash;1. Over this period, the age at 50\% maturity for dogfish declined from 43\^A~to 32\^A~years, while the estimated average number of embryos per litter for a 100\^A~cm dogfish increased from 5.9 to 6.7. Growth parameters changed significantly, with faster growth to a smaller size. Leslie matrix analysis showed that these changes could lead to an increase in population growth rate of about 1\%. Comparison with published demographic parameters from the 1970s and 1980s indicated that the greatest change in demographic parameters occurred between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the largest changes in ocean temperatures. The implications for fishing on long-lived populations during times of rapid environmental change are explored.},

  abstract = {Abstract An experiment was done to quantify species-specific variation in temporal hooking rates from demersal longlines targeting various carcharhinids off south eastern Australia, with a view to reducing the incidental catches of protected species, including the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini, great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran and grey nurse Carcharias taurus. The longline comprised a 9600 m mainline, separated into four sections (termed lines) each with 120 gangions (20 m apart) rigged with hook timers and 16/0 circle hooks baited with either sea mullet Mugil cephalus or eastern Australian salmon Arripis trutta. The mainline was deployed on each of 17 nights (between 19:30 and 23:30~h), with two lines retrieved after 7 and 14~h respectively. From a total of 8160 hooks, 246 timers were activated without hooking fish. Twenty-two species comprising 684 individuals were caught, including 52 S. lewini, 12 C. taurus, 11 S. mokarran and 1 loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Several environmental factors, including water temperature, moon phase and depth had mostly homogeneous, positive effects on catches. The only identified variables that might be used to considerably reduce the catches of Sphyrna were soak time and/or diurnal gear retrieval, with most individuals hooked during daylight. Simply mandating shorter deployments and within nocturnal retrieval might limit exploitation, especially among juveniles ( lt; 150 cm total length). For the studied fishery to approach sustainability, future research is required to investigate other gear modifications for improving size and species selectivity, and/or operational procedures for mitigating discard and escape mortalities.},

The present study describes the quantitative relationships among age, growth and reproductive biology of two commercially exploited sharks from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), namely, the spot-tail shark, Carcharhinus sorrah (n~=~659) and the Australian blacktip shark, C. tilstoni (n~=~512). Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3\textendash{}2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2\textendash{}6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought.},

We believe such indices are inappropriate both as measures of precision and for comparative purposes because they do not properly account for age effects or take the experimental design into consideration. We suggest that if the overall level of agreement is low between two ageing methods used on the same sample of fish, then one can use a test of symmetry to look for evidence of systematic disagreement. A chi(2) test is used to determine if the number of fish assigned age i from method 1 and age j from method 2 differs significantly from the number of fish assigned age j from method 1 and age i from method 2. Such a test can also be used to determine the range of nominal ages over which two methods appear to give comparable results.},

  abstract = {Mustelus antarcticus, endemic to southern Australia, exhibits matrotrophic aplacental viviparity. Differences in synchronous ovarian and parturition cycles, mostly annual west and biennial east of longitude 138 degrees E, are explained by environmental differences. Ovulation and parturition peak during November-December and the gestation period is similar to 12 months. Largest ovarian follicle diameter ranges from 15 to 28 mm at ovulation, and mean wet mass gain is 10-fold from in utero egg (similar to 10 g) to full-term embryo (similar to 100 g) at similar to 330mm total length. The sex ratio of embryos in utero is 1:1, and litter size (1 to 57 embryos) rises curvilinearly with maternal length. Length-at-maternity and length-at-maturity increased with rising fishing mortality and subsequently decreased with falling fishing mortality. These patterns are explained by the hypothesis on the 'phenomenon of apparent change of size-at-maternity' (and size-at-maturity) caused by gill-net length-selective fishing mortality, which masks any potential density-dependent responses. Male length-at-maturity estimates from seminal vesicle condition, testis development and spermatogenesis stages are similar, but are less than estimates from clasper calcification. Maximum body mass of females is double that of males and, at any length $>$ 700 mm, mean body mass of females exceeds that of males.},

Adult \emph{R. taylori }also persist in the bay, a behavioural pattern possibly explained by their small maximum size. While present immediately after birth the type of utilisation pattern displayed by \emph{Sphyrna lewimi }could not be clarified in this study. Although diets of these species in the bay are similar, there is probably little direct competition for food due to the highly productive habitats in the bay supporting an abundance of food resources. The highest numbers of juveniles occur when prey species are most abundant, and when temporal separation of some seasonally-occuring species of sharks in effect.},

Differences in the external morphology between S. acanthias and S. suckleyi are subtle and are likely to be masked by intraspecific variation within individuals. However, we found S. suckleyi to differ from S. acanthias based on the following morphological and meristic characteristics: a short, broadly-rounded to acute snout; first dorsal-fin midpoint more posterior to pectoral-fin insertion; pelvic-fin origin closer to second dorsal fin than first dorsal fin; total vertebral counts average 99 (97-106). Molecular analysis of approximately 650 bp of the CO1 mitochondrial gene (DNA barcode region) showed separation of S. suckleyi and S. acanthias into two distinct genetic clades with 98\% bootstrap support. Within species genetic diversities were 0.109 +/- 0.036\% and 0.176 +/- 0.041\% for S. suckleyi and S. acanthias respectively; between species diversity was 5-6 fold greater at 0.765 +/- 0.307\%. Squalus suckleyi is thus resurrected and a neotype for this endemic North Pacific Squalus species is designated.},

The vertebrae of 41 females (41-181 cm precaudal length [PCL]) and 51 males (42-182 cm PCL) were examined. Three methods successfully enhanced the visibility of growth rings: crystal violet staining of the centrum face, microscopic examination of the whole vertebra, with transmitted light and dark field, and ''bow tie'' sectioning of the vertebra. The results of the three methods were compared by using the average percentage error index and statistical means. Age and growth estimates were obtained from microscopic examination of the whole vertebra, the method which provided the most accurate ring counts and gave the second highest reproducibility. The data for males and females were combined and the von Bertalanffy parameters obtained were L(infinity) = 193.6 cm PCL, K = 0.21 yr(-1) and t(o) = -1.2 yr. Age at maturity was 7 years (156 cm PCL) for females and 6 years (150 cm PCL) for males. The oldest aged female was 11 years (179 cm PCL), the oldest aged male was 10 years (179 cm PCL) old. Mean calculated growth rates were 24 cm/yr for the first three years, 11-13 cm/yr through adolescence, and 5-6 cm/yr after maturity. Back-calculated lengths were lower than observed lengths and Lee's phenomenon was apparent. In 83\% of the vertebrae the band immediately after the change in angle was translucent. Opaque band deposition is assumed to occur in summer.},

Mercury concentration was highly dependent on shark size and increased more or less exponentially with length. Apart from \emph{S. lewini} and \emph{S. mokarran}, there were significant differences between length-mercury relationships for males and females of each species. At a given length, males tended to have accumulated higher concentrations of mercury than females.

  abstract = {A relationship has not been established among models for yield per recruit analysis, models for demographic analysis, and age- and time-dependent models. Also, current models for-demographic analysis are number-based; biomass-based models have not been derived. Moreover, existing models for demographic analysis deal only with, females. The main difficulty in modelling the entire population lies in calculating the intrinsic rate of increase with time for males. Because males of dioecious species do not give birth to offspring, do they have an intrinsic rate of increase with time, at all? If so, is it zero? If not, what is it, and how can it be calculated? Without answering these questions, any sex-specific model for demographic analysis fails. In this paper, I establish an explicit relationship among models for yield per recruit analysis, models for demographic analysis, and age- and time-dependent models; develop workable sex-specific, number- and biomass-based models for demographic analysis by deriving formulae for calculating the intrinsic rate of increase with time for females, males, or both; show that Beverton and Holt's yield per recruit analysis is a special case of demographic analysis; and use models for demographic analysis and. models for yield per recruit analysis to analyse data on gummy shark Mustelus antarcticus in Bass Strait and school shark Galeorhinus galeus off southern Australia. Many quantities were computed for gummy and school sharks, including their intrinsic rates of increase with time; number- and biomass-based means and variances of the ages of females, males and both sexes in the population; and yield per recruit in number or in biomass, all as a function of the maximum instantaneous rate of fishing mortality of all those at all (total) lengths or ages q. Also computed were number- and biomass-based proportions of fish of a certain sex among all fish of that sex; those of fish among all fish in the population; and number- and biomass-based sex ratio, all as a function of age and q.

  volume = {337},
  abstract = {The concept of elasmobranch species using nursery areas was introduced in the early 1900s and has been an accepted aspect of shark biology and behavior for several decades. Despite several descriptions of how shark species use nursery areas and what types of regions nurseries may be found in, no explicit definition of what constitutes a shark nursery area has been presented. Here we evaluate the assumptions of the current shark nursery paradigm in light of available data. Based on examination of these assumptions and available methods of quantifying and accurately describing shark nursery areas, a new more quantitative definition of shark nursery areas is proposed. This definition requires 3 criteria to be met for an area to be identified as a nursery: (1) sharks are more commonly encountered in the area than other areas; (2) sharks have a tendency to remain or return for extended periods; and (3) the area or habitat is repeatedly used across years. These criteria make the definition of shark nursery areas more compatible with those for other aquatic species. The improved definition of this concept will provide more valuable information for fisheries managers and shark biologists.},

I used age-structured life tables and Leslie matrices based on a prebreeding survey and a yearly time step applied only to females to model the demography of 41 populations from 38 species of sharks representing four orders and nine families. I used Monte Carlo simulation to reflect uncertainty in the estimates of demographic traits and to calculate population statistics and elasticities for these populations; I used correlation analysis to identify the demographic traits that explained most of the variation in population growth rates (lambda). The populations I examined fell along a continuum of life-history characteristics that can be linked to elasticity patterns. Sharks characterized by early age at maturity, short lifespan, and large litter size had high lambda values and short generation times, whereas sharks that mature late and have long lifespans and small litters have low lambda values and long generation times. Sharks at the "fast" end of the spectrum tended to have comparable adult and juvenile survival elasticities, whereas sharks at the "slow" end of the continuum had high juvenile survival elasticity and low age-zero survival (or fertility) elasticity. Ratios of adult survival to fertility elasticities and juvenile survival to fertility elasticities suggest that many of the populations studied do not possess the biological attributes necessary to restore lambda to its original level after moderate levels of exploitation. Elasticity analysis suggests that changes in juvenile survival would have the greatest effect on lambda, and correlation analysis indicates that variation in juvenile survival, age at maturity, and reproduction account for most of the variation in lambda. In general, combined results from elasticity and correlation analyses suggest that research, conservation, and management efforts should focus on these demographic traits.},

A total of 26 species of carcharhinids, representing half of the species in the Carcharhinidae, were recorded. The most abundant species, in terms of numbers recorded, were Scoliodon laticaudus and Carcharhinus falciformis, while the most abundant in terms of biomass were Prionace glauca, C. falciformis and Carcharhinus obscurus. Biological data are presented for 22 of the 26 species. The total length at which males attain maturity (L50) was determined for 10 species.

The species constituted 9,3\% of the total shark catch. Annual catches and catch rates fluctuated about a mean of 131 sharks and 3,3 sharks.km-net-1.year-1 respectively. Mature sharks, which constituted about two-thirds of the catch, were caught in similar numbers throughout the netted region but catches of immature animals increased towards the north. Catches took place throughout the year but were lowest from July to October. Most males reached maturity at 146-150 cm precaudal length (PCL) and females at 151-155 cm. Mean gonad indices in mature males were highest during September and October and in females during November and December. Males and females considered to be in mating condition were found predominantly in November and December. There is some evidence for a three-year reproductive cycle, and gestation lasts about 12 months. The smallest of 151 pregnant females was 146 cm PCL. Median litter size was six embryos (maximum 11) and mean embryo length within a litter ranged from 13 to 49 cm PCL. Larger females had more and larger embryos. Teleosts were found in 83\% of non-empty stomachs, but there was regional and seasonal variation in the diet.},

It is common along the southeast coast of the United States, where it migrates northward to Georgia and the Carolinas in summer and southward to Florida in winter. The blacktip shark feeds on small bony fishes, primarily menhaden, and small elasmobranchs. Males mature between 1,425 and 1,450 mm TL, and all males over 1450 mm TL are mature. Females mature at about 1,560 mm TL. The reproductive cycle lasts 2 years and includes biennial ovulation with a 1-year gestation period. Mating and ovulation occur in Bulls Bay, South Carolina, from mid-May to early June. Parturition occurs the following year from early May to early June in the shallow coastal waters of the Carolinas. The blacktip shark is a viviparous, placental species. Implantation usually occurs during the 10th and 11th weeks of gestation when the embryos measure 178-194 mm TL. The young are born at about 550-600 mm TL during May and early June in the shallow water, coastal nurseries of Georgia and the Carolinas. The neonate stage lasts about a month. The young remain in the shallow water nurseries until fall.},

  abstract = {Between 1978 and 1999, a total of 5 626 dusky sharks Carcharhinus; obscurus, constituting 20 \% of the total shark catch, was caught in the protective nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The mean annual catch was 256 sharks (SD = 107.5, range 129-571). There was no significant linear trend in catch rate with time. Of the total C. obscurus catch, 677 (12 \%) were found alive and 217 of these (3.8 \%) were tagged and released. Only three tagged animals were recaptured. The size frequency distribution of the catch was trimodal, the modes of each sex consisting of small (mostly neonate), medium (adolescent) and large (mostly mature) sharks respectively. Geographical and seasonal distributions were characteristic for each of these size categories. Females significantly outnumbered males in all size categories, the greatest disparity (2.72:1) being in large animals. This probably reflects the movement inshore of near-term pregnant females to drop their pups. On 128 occasions, groups of five or more sharks were found together in a net installation, the largest group consisting of 113 animals. Group catches tended to coincide with the annual 'sardine run', a seasonal influx of Sardinops sagax. The sardine run affects the distribution of medium and large sharks. Few animals were sampled in mating condition and there were few newly pregnant or midterm females, but there are indications that the gestation period may be as much as two years. Teleosts dominated the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence (63 \%) and elasmobranchs in terms of mass (51.4 \%).},

  abstract = {Understanding spatio-temporal patterns in shark occurrence is critical for assessing the ecological role of a species, its vulnerability to human impacts and environmental change, and the efficacy of conservation and management strategies. Investigating these patterns can also develop an understanding of the functioning of coastal shark nurseries. In this context, we undertook a multi-year fisheries-independent survey of shark occurrence along a 400-km stretch of tropical coastline. Logistic regression was used to identify spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variations in the occurrence of neonate and young-of-the-year (YOY) blacktip Carcharhinus limbatus/Carcharhinus tilstoni, pigeye Carcharhinus amboinensis, scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and spot-tail Carcharhinus sorrah sharks. Results indicated interspecific variations in occurrence. Seasonal variations characterised the occurrence of YOY pigeye, YOY spot-tail and neonate blacktip sharks, whereas spatial variations were more pronounced for YOY blacktip and scalloped hammerhead sharks. These results suggested that the occurrence of young sharks may be more complex than would be predicted by the timing of parturition alone. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in occurrence suggested that proximate bays are likely to vary in terms of the services they provide to young sharks.},

  volume = {11},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0150911},
  abstract = {Southeast Florida witnesses an enormous seasonal influx of upper trophic level marine predators each year as massive aggregations of migrating blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) overwinter in nearshore waters. The narrow shelf and close proximity of the Gulf Stream current to the Palm Beach County shoreline drive tens of thousands of sharks to the shallow, coastal environment. This natural bottleneck provides a unique opportunity to estimate relative abundance. Over a four year period from 2011\^a2014, an aerial survey was flown approximately biweekly along the length of Palm Beach County. A high definition video camera and digital still camera mounted out of the airplane window provided a continuous record of the belt transect which extended 200 m seaward from the shoreline between Boca Raton Inlet and Jupiter Inlet. The number of sharks within the survey transect was directly counted from the video. Shark abundance peaked in the winter (January-March) with a maximum in 2011 of 12,128 individuals counted within the 75.6 km-2 belt transect. This resulted in a maximum density of 803.2 sharks km-2. By the late spring (April-May), shark abundance had sharply declined to 1.1\% of its peak, where it remained until spiking again in January of the following year. Shark abundance was inversely correlated with water temperature and large numbers of sharks were found only when water temperatures were less than 25\^A$^\circ$C. Shark abundance was also correlated with day of the year but not with barometric pressure. Although shark abundance was not correlated with photoperiod, the departure of the sharks from southeast Florida occurred around the vernal equinox. The shark migration along the United States eastern seaboard corresponds spatially and temporally with the spawning aggregations of various baitfish species. These baseline abundance data can be compared to future studies to determine if shark population size is changing and if sharks are restricting their southward migration as global water temperatures increase.},

The checklist includes nine orders, 34 families, 105 genera and 509 species of sharks; six orders, 24 families, 88 genera and 630 species of batoids (skates and rays); one order, three families, six genera and 49 species of holocephalans (chimaeras). The most speciose shark orders are the Carcharhiniformes with 284 species, followed by the Squaliformes with 119. The most species\^arich batoid orders are the Rajiformes with 285 species and the Myliobatiformes with 210. This checklist represents the first global checklist of chondrichthyans to include information on maximum size, geographic and depth distributions, as well as comments on taxonomically problematic species and recent and regularly overlooked synonymizations. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the biogeographical diversity of the species across 10 major areas of occurrence is given, including updated figures for previously published hotspots of chondrichthyan biodiversity, providing the detailed numbers of chondrichthyan species per major area, and revealing centres of distribution for several taxa},
